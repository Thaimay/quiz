## Use with cordova
Cordova is not enabled by default, so make sure to remove the comment tags around the `<script src="cordova.js"></script>` line in [projectroot]/src/index.html
```
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>

  <!-- Cordova -->

  <script src="cordova.js"></script>

  <!-- built script files will be auto injected -->
</body>
```
It will be added during the build process to Android/iOS.

Just put the contents of `www` folder in your cordova's project root `www` folder
